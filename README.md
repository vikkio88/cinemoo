# cinemoo
a guy who knows everything about cinema

this one was a test project to make a website which could read movies wikipedia articles and make you do search to retrieve complex information from them, like, if you were wondering who was the actor who made Neo in matrix, you could search:
"Neo in Matrix" > Cinemoo > "Keanu Reeves"
or
"Main character in Matrix" > Cinemoo > "Keanu Reeves"

you could also ask for complex stuff, like:
movies of (Neo in Matrix) and (darth vader in Start wars new hope) > Cinemoo > "" (what a bad example)


The project is stilla draft and I had no time at all to finish it, and the main problem is that works just with italian wikipedia template for moives.
